=head1 NAME

Doc::Type - Used to represent different types in a typegraph

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Doc::Type;

    # create and name it
    my $type = Doc::Type.new(:name("Rat"));

    # add some properties
    $type.super.push(["Any", "Mu", "Numeric"]);
    $type.roles.push(["Role1", "Role2"]);

    # and get its MRO!
    say $type.mro;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Doc::Type> represents a type in the Raku language. It stores
its parent classes and the role it's implementing. In addition, it also
stores the inverted relation, that's to say: all types inheriting from
this one, and if it's a role, all types implementing it.
